# Coding Agent Instructions

This project is a **Microsoft Foundry hosted agent** — a containerized AI agent that runs in [Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents). The platform handles containerization, hosting, security, scaling, and observability so you can focus on agent logic.

This agent uses the **Activity protocol** (Bot Framework / M365 Agents SDK), so it is reached through a **Bot channel (Microsoft Teams)** rather than the request/response `azd ai agent invoke` path used by the responses/invocations protocols.

## Key files

- `main.py` — the activity handlers (`message` echoes the user's text; `conversationUpdate` welcomes new members)
- `Dockerfile` — container definition

## Development workflow

The **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** manages the full lifecycle:

```bash
azd ai agent run                 
azd deploy                       # Deploy to Foundry (creates the Azure Bot + Teams channel)
```

Activity agents are push-based: the agent replies out-of-band through the Bot
Connector, so `azd ai agent invoke` (which reads a synchronous response body) does
**not** apply here. Test a deployed agent by chatting with it in **Microsoft Teams**
(package/sideload the Teams app produced during deploy). For a local terminal loop,
POST a synthetic activity to `http://localhost:8088/activity/messages` with a
`serviceUrl` pointing at a local catcher.

## Microsoft Foundry Skill

Install the **Microsoft Foundry Skill** for guided deployment, evaluation, and troubleshooting workflows.

Direct install (preferred, works with any coding agent):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/microsoft/azure-skills --skill microsoft-foundry
```

Or install the Azure Skills Plugin:

- **Copilot CLI**: `/plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-skills` then `/plugin install azure@azure-skills`
- **Claude Code**: `/plugin install azure@claude-plugins-official`

Then ask naturally, e.g. `Use the Microsoft Foundry Skill to deploy this agent.`
